# Spotify
Data Science with My Personal Spotify Data:

Used my personal Spotify data to create top song and top artist data visualizations.

Utilized [Gensims](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) Doc2Vec model to calculate lyric embeddings based on Quoc Le and Tomas Mikolov's: [â€œDistributed Representations of Sentences and Documents"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053v2.pdf) Paragraph Vector model.
By inputting a certain song calculated the top similar songs based on the pure lyrical word embeddings.
