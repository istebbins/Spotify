# Spotify
### Data Science with My Personal Spotify Data:

* Used my personal Spotify data to create top song and top artist data visualizations.

* Scraped data from Lyric Website Genius using [lyricsgenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (Python client for Genius API)

* Utilized [Gensims](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) Doc2Vec model to calculate lyric embeddings based on Quoc Le and Tomas Mikolov's: [â€œDistributed Representations of Sentences and Documents"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053v2.pdf) Paragraph Vector model.

* Identified top similar songs to an input based on the Doc2Vec models lyrical word embeddings. Gave successful suggestions from both the same artist and other artists.
